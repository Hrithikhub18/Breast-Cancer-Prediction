# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using machine learning models. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model comparison (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, LightGBM), and evaluation using accuracy and F1 scores. A user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter allows interactive predictions by entering tumor features.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparison of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and LightGBM
- Tkinter GUI for live predictions

## Files in this Repository
- `Breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with all code
- `Breast_cancer_data.csv` — Dataset used for training and testing

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn lightgbm
